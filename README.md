# App::ChmWeb

This is a tool for generating browsable web pages from CHM (Microsoft Compiled HTML Help) files.

Broadly speaking, it works by unpacking the chm with 7zip and then altering/generating HTML files to fix any broken links, ActiveX controls or other things that don't work in normal browsers.

**NOTE**: This is still very early in development.
